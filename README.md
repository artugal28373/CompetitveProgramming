# Competitve Programming


**Algorithm Implementation:** This folder contains all the codes of all the algorithms I generally use in the programming contests. Most of them are my implementation. But there are also few codes which I added or modified from the template library of forthright48(Samiul Islam vaiya) and Zobayer Hasan vaiya and Flash7(Tarango Khan vaiya).

**Resources:** This folder contains some resources which help me to understand various topics.

**Onlinbe Judge Solutions:** This folder contains my online judge solutions with solution idea and comments.

**Template:** This folder contains the base template I normally use during coding. Also it contains some c++ template like big integer/fast io etc which we need sometimes during solving problems.

**Algorithm based Problem Solution:** This repository contains implementation of different algorithm based online judge problem. In this repository the solutions are categorized by algorithm.
